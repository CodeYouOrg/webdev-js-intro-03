1. When a number is added to a string the program converts the number to a string data type before concatenizing them.  This just makes logical sense since it would be foolish and impossile to try to convert a string to a number.  
2. == evaluates both data type and value.  This will cause issues when using it for strings.  
3.  None of the operators are confusing.
4. Modulus returns the remainder.  One would use that to check if a number is divisible by another number.  One scenrio would be when trying to determine if a number is even or odd.
